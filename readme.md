**SGDK** is a free development kit allowing development of software in **C language** for the **Sega Mega Drive**.
It contains the development library itself (with the code sources) and some custom tools used to compile resources.
SGDK uses the GCC compiler (m68k-elf target) and the libgcc to generate a ROM image. Binaries (GCC 13.2) are provided for Windows OS for convenience, but you need to install it by yourself for other operating systems (more infos about it in *HELP AND SUPPORT* section).
Note that SGDK also requires Java (custom tools require it), so you need to have Java installed on your system.

SGDK library and custom tools are distributed under the MIT license (see [license.txt](license.txt) file).
GCC compiler and libgcc are under GNU license (GPL3) and any software build from it (as the SGDK library) is under the GCC runtime library exception license (see [COPYING.RUNTIME](COPYING.RUNTIME) file)
 
## GETTING STARTED

First, you need to know that SGDK uses the C language (assembly is also possible, but not necessary) so it's highly recommended to be familiar with C programming before trying to develop with SGDK. Learning C language at same time as learning 'Sega Mega Drive' programming is definitely too difficult and you will end up getting nowhere. It's also important to have, at least, a basic knowledge of the Sega Mega Drive hardware (specifically the video system).

### INSTALLATION AND DOCUMENTATION 

Then when you feel ready you can go further and finally install SGDK :)

You can find installation instructions and tutorials about how use SGDK on the wiki:<br>
https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/wiki

SGDK also comes with an online doxygen documentation (generated from .h header files) which provides descriptions for all SGDK structures and functions:<br>
http://stephane-d.github.io/SGDK/

It's important to know that SGDK heavily relies on _resources_ which are compiled through the _rescomp_ tool. You should read the [rescomp.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/master/bin/rescomp.txt) file to understand **which kind of resources you can use and how to declare them**. Then you can look at the *'sample'* folder from SGDK and, in particular, the [sonic sample](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/tree/master/sample/game/sonic) which is a good showcase of SGDK usage in general (functions and resources).

### OTHERS TUTORIALS

You can find a lot of tutorials online about SGDK but be careful, some are outdated and/or they contains errors.<br>
I really recommend starting from the [wiki](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/wiki) which provides the basics to start.<br>
Then if you need more _visual_ and complete tutorials you can give either of these a try:<br>
MD programming tutorials from Ohsat:<br>
https://www.ohsat.com/tutorial/mdmisc/creating-graphics-for-md/<br>
Very complete and visual tutorials from Danibus (spanish only):<br>
https://danibus.wordpress.com/<br>
Youtube tutorial series from Pigsy:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnGqc5OTTY4&list=PL1xqkpO_SvY2_rSwHTBIBxXMqmek--GAb<br>

### USEFUL TOOLS

Here's a list of useful tools that will help you to create your assets:

#### Pixel art / Sprite

* [Asesprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)
* [Graphics gale](https://graphicsgale.com/)
* [Pro Motion](https://www.cosmigo.com/)
* [Grafx2](http://grafx2.chez.com/)
* [Palette quantizer](https://rilden.github.io/tiledpalettequant/): powerful online tool to convert your image within the Sega Mega Drive palette constraints

#### Map / Level

* [16Tile](https://allone-works.itch.io/16tile): SGDK specific tile map editor
* [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/): Tile map editor, supported by SGDK resource compiler tool
* [LDTK](https://deepnight.net/tools/ldtk-2d-level-editor/): New but powerful tile map editor (support Tiled formats as well)
* [Ogmo](https://ogmo-editor-3.github.io/): Another nice and simple tile map editor
* [Palette merger](https://github.com/bolon667/paletteMergerForSGDK): A tool allowing to easily change tile palette index and priority

#### Music / sound

* [Deflemask](https://www.deflemask.com/): music tracker supporting several system as the Sega Mega Drive
* [Furnace](https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace): new music tracker supporting many systems
* [Wavosaur](https://www.wavosaur.com/): wave sound editor (windows only)
* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/): wave sound editor (all OS)

#### Alternates sound drivers

SGDK sound drivers may not fit your needs so it's important to know that some alternatives exist:
* [MDSDRV](https://github.com/superctr/MDSDRV): powerful sound driver support FM & PSG SFX, pitchable PCM playback...
* [Echo](https://github.com/sikthehedgehog/Echo): another sound driver supporting FM & PSG SFX and working 100% on Z80 CPU.
* [MiniMusic](https://github.com/sikthehedgehog/minimusic): a tiny Z80 sound driver for Mega Drive that runs entirely off Z80 RAM
and doesn't access the cartridge slot.
 
 
## HELP AND SUPPORT

If you need help or support with SGDK, you can join the SGDK Discord server:<br>
https://discord.gg/xmnBWQS

You can also go to the Spritesmind forum which is dedicated to Sega Mega Drive development and has a specific section for SGDK:<br>
http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/
 
### LINUX / MACOSX

There are several solutions to get SGDK working on Linux, here's a list of some of them:<br>

* Very simple script from Vojtěch Salajka allowing you to use SGDK from Wine easily:<br>
https://github.com/Franticware/SGDK_wine

* The SGDK Helper from tlsa allows you to use SGDK both from a native or a container environment:<br>
https://github.com/tlsa/sgdk-helper

* Another great alternative is to use the complete _MarsDev_ environment developed by Andy Grind:<br>
https://github.com/andwn/marsdev
It supports all OSes, provides SGDK compatibility as well as 32X support, so be sure to check it out !

* MacOSX users also have access to this specific solution from Sonic3D (probably a bit outdated though):<br>
https://github.com/SONIC3D/gendev-macos

### DOCKER

SGDK doesn't provide anymore any integrated Docker solution as the Doragasu docker solution seems better, faster and simpler to use (native linux compiler):<br>
https://gitlab.com/doragasu/docker-sgdk
 
### VS CODE

Almost everyone now use VSCode editor and the nice extension made by zerasul called *Genesis-Code* makes SGDK integration even smoother:<br>
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zerasul.genesis-code
Just install and setup it as it's detailled on the extension page ('GDK/SGDK' and 'Gens' emulator paths mainly) and you're ready to use it :)<br>
You can type *Genesis* in the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P shortcut) to see all commands supported by the extension.<br>
SGDK also now integrates a VSCode template located in _project/template_ folder so you can just create a copy of this folder (for instance _project/test_) and open it in VSCode to start your own project.

### AWS

Yes you're reading correctly, thanks to Matthew Nimmo you can even now use SGDK from AWS !<br>
Here's the link to his blog which explain how to do that:<br>
https://community.aws/content/2hZInsYwWX8cYEAIFKquutVoYQj/how-to-build-retro-games-in-aws-using-sega-genesis-development-kit-sgdk

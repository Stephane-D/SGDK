 *      This actually happen when Z80 access the main BUS exactly at same time you trigger a DMA operation.<br>

 *
 *      The new error handler, however, completely takes over exception vectors and doesn't allow to set your own callbacks for errors (e.g. addressErrorCB).<br>
 *      If you rely on callbacks to override error handling behavior, consider using legacy system instead.

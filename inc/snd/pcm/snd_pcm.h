 * This unit provides playback method for the <b>Z80_DRIVER_PCM</b> sound driver.<br>
 *<br>
 * Sound driver description:<br>
 * This sound driver allow Single PCM channel 8 bits signed sample driver.<br>
 * It can play a sample (8 bit signed) from 8 Khz up to 32 Khz rate.<br>
 *<br>
 * Note that SGDK sound drivers may not fit your needs so it's important to know<br>
 * that some alternatives sound drivers exist (see SGDK readme.md for more info)

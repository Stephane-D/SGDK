 *
 * This unit provides playback method for the <b>Z80_DRIVER_PCM4</b> sound driver.<br>
 * Sound driver description:<br>
 * 4 channels 8 bits signed sample driver with volume support.<br>
 * It can mix up to 4 samples (8 bit signed) at a fixed 16 Khz rate.<br>
 * with volume support (16 levels du to memory limitation).<br>
 * Address and size of samples have to be 256 bytes boundary.<br>
 * The driver does support "cutoff" when mixing so you can use true 8 bits samples :)<br>
 *<br>
 * Note that SGDK sound drivers may not fit your needs so it's important to know<br>
 * that some alternatives sound drivers exist (see SGDK readme.md for more info)

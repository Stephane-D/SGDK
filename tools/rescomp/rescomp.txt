ResComp is part of SGDK (aka Sega Genesis Dev Kit).
It allows to compile different type of resource and output them in assembly source form.

Usage: rescomp resource.rc [out.s] [-noheader]

If output file is not specified it takes the same name as input with .s extension.
Note that the header file (.h) is generated except if you use the -noheader parameter.

Supported resource type:
- BITMAP    bitmapped image type resource, used for the Bitmap SGDK engine (do not use it as tile resource).
- PALETTE   palette type resource, used as color input for Bitmap, Image or Sprite resource.
- TILESET   tileset type resource, contains tiles data which are used by Image or Sprite resource.
- MAP       map type resource (tilemap data).
- IMAGE     image type resource, internally contains Palette, Tileset and Map data and can be used to draw a complete background.
- SPRITE    sprite type resource, used to handle sprites with the SGDK Sprite engine..
- TFM       TFM music type resource (.tfd or .tfc file only), used to play music.
- VGM       VGM music type resource (.vgm file only), used to play music.
- WAV       WAV sound type resource (.wav file only), used to play sample sound data.
- PCM       PCM sound type resource (.pcm file only), used to play sample sound data.
- BIN       any binary data file which do not need any specific any conversion or processing.


PALETTE
-------
Take a .pal file or an image as input and transform it in SGDK Palette structure.
If the input image is 1 pixel heigth then the width is the palette size and pixel X represent color data at index X.
In others cases the usual image palette data is used instead.

Palette is used as color input for Bitmap, Image and Sprite resources.

Syntax:
PALETTE name file [index]

    name        name of the output Bitmap structure
    file        path of the input image file (should be 8bpp .bmp or .png) or .pal file
    index       start index where to copy the palette in Sega Genesis CRAM.


BITMAP
------
Take an image as input and transform it in SGDK Bitmap structure.
Bitmap image structure is used for the SGDK BMP (bitmap) engine, do not use it for tiled image.

Syntax:
BITMAP name img_file [compression]

    name          name of the output Bitmap structure
    img_file      path of the input image file (should be 8bpp .bmp or .png)
    compression   compression type (use unpackBitmap(..) to unpack)
                    -1 = AUTO (use best compression scheme)
                    0 = NONE (no compression)
                    1 = APLIB (aplib library)
                    2 = LZKN (Konami LZW compression, disable for legal reason)
                    3 = RLE (4bits RLE compression)
                    4 = RLE MAP (tilemap adapted RLE)

    img_file      path of the input image file (should be 8bpp .bmp or .png)
    compression   compression type (use unpackTileSet(..) to unpack)
                    -1 = AUTO (use best compression scheme)
                    0 = NONE (no compression)
                    1 = APLIB (aplib library)
                    2 = LZKN (Konami LZW compression, disable for legal reason)

    compression   compression type (use unpackMap(..) to unpack)
                    -1 = AUTO (use best compression scheme)
                    0 = NONE (no compression)
                    1 = APLIB (aplib library)
                    2 = LZKN (Konami LZW compression, disable for legal reason)
                    3 = RLE (4bits RLE compression)
                    4 = RLE MAP (tilemap adapted RLE)


IMAGE
-----

    name          name of the output Image structure
    img_file      path of the input image file (should be 8bpp .bmp or .png)
    compression   compression type (use unpackImage(..) to unpack)
                    -1 = AUTO (use best compression scheme)
                    0 = NONE (no compression)
                    1 = APLIB (aplib library)
                    2 = LZKN (Konami LZW compression, disable for legal reason)
                    3 = RLE (4bits RLE compression)
                    4 = RLE MAP (tilemap adapted RLE)


SPRITE
------
Take an image as input and transform it in SGDK SpriteDefinition structure.
SpriteDefinition is used to draw, animate and manage sprites, it internally contains severals TileSet, Palette and Animation structures.

Syntax:
SPRITE name img_file width heigth [compression [time [collision]]]

    name          name of the output SpriteDefinition structure
    img_file      path of the input image file (should be 8bpp .bmp or .png)
    width         width of a single sprite frame in tile (should be <= 20)
    heigth        heigth of a single sprite frame in tile (should be <= 20)
    compression   compression type (use unpackSprite(..) to unpack)
                   -1 = AUTO (use best compression scheme)
                    0 = NONE (no compression)
                    1 = APLIB (aplib library)
                    2 = LZKN (Konami LZW compression, disable for legal reason)
                    3 = RLE (4bits RLE compression)
                    4 = RLE MAP (tilemap adapted RLE)
    time          display frame time in 1/60 of second (time between each animation frame)
    collision     collision type: CIRCLE, BOX or NONE (BOX by default)

Some informations about how SpriteDefinition is generated from the input image:
- input image dimension is aligned on tile (multiple of 8).
- input image is a grid where each cell represents a single sprite frame and where a row define a complete sprite animation.
- cell size (frame size) = width * height (in tile)
- a frame can be composed of several internal VDP sprites (max = 20) if width or height are > 4.
- rescomp detect flipped frame to avoid redundant sprite tiles.
- rescomp detect empty frame at end of animation row to not store empty frame data.
- rescomp detect frame copy inside an animation to generate the according animation sequence.
- collision bounds are calculated by using 75% of the original sprite frame.
- In future rescomp could detect empty tiles in a frame to optimize the internal VDP sprite usage (and also improve the collision box).
That may be a nice future addition :)


TFM

 * This unit provides advanced sound playback methods through differents Z80 drivers.<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_PCM</b><br>
 * Single channel 8 bits signed sample driver.<br>
 * It can play a sample (8 bit signed) from 8 Khz up to 32 Khz rate.<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_2ADPCM</b><br>
 * 2 channels 4 bits ADPCM sample driver.<br>
 * It can mix up to 2 ADCPM samples at a fixed 22050 Hz Khz rate.<br>
 * Address and size of samples have to be 256 bytes boundary.<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_4PCM_ENV</b><br>
 * 4 channels 8 bits signed sample driver with volume support.<br>
 * It can mix up to 4 samples (8 bit signed) at a fixed 16 Khz rate.<br>
 * with volume support (16 levels du to memory limitation).<br>
 * Address and size of samples have to be 256 bytes boundary.<br>
 * The driver does support "cutoff" when mixing so you can use true 8 bits samples :)<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_MVS</b><br>
 * MVS music player driver.<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_TFM</b><br>
 * TFM music player driver.<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_VGM</b><br>
 * VGM music player driver.<br>
 * It supports 1 PCM channel at a fixed 8 Khz and allows to play SFX through the named PCM channel.<br>
 * Written by Sigflup and kubilus1.
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_XGM</b><br>
 * eXtended VGM music player driver.<br>
 * This driver takes VGM (or XGM) file as input to play music.<br>
 * It supports 4 PCM channels at a fixed 14 Khz and allows to play SFX through PCM with 16 level of priority.<br>
 * The driver is designed to avoid DMA contention when possible (depending CPU load).

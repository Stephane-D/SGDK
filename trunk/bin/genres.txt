GenRes helps you to compile resource without any external convertor.
genres source.rc dest.asm

This release includes 4 plugins
- BITMAP plugin
- SPRITE plugin
- MAP plugin
- ANI plugin

Also included an incomplete sample, full source isn't available because it's a mess.
But you can see what I was able to do with GenRes ;)
Use button A to change sample and arrow keys on Map and Ani samples.

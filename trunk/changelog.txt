SGDK 0.96d (june 2014):
-----------------------

LIBRARY
* removed direct VRam Map data unpacking as it was buggy.


SGDK 0.96c (june 2014):
-----------------------

COMPILER
* Rescomp:
 - fixed some issues on compression.
 - now accept string to define which compression to use (AUTO, APLIB, RLE) in resource definition. 

LIBRARY
* minors changes to Doxygen documentation. 


SGDK 0.96 (may 2014):
---------------------

COMPILER
* Rescomp:
 - improved BMP image support.
 - byte data are now output in word format to avoid the GCC bug (compilation with "-g" flag fails when byte data is encountered).
 - fixed issue on empty sprite animation detection.
 - fixed path separator issue on old windows system.
 - fixed compilation issues on unix system.
* Makefile:
 - Added "release" and "debug" target to makefile (default is "release").
  "debug" target allow you to use GDB interactive debugger through emulator supporting it.
* added appack tool sources code (compatibility for linux system).
* some cleanup in bintos tool (removed the useless sizealign command done by sizebnd tool).

LIBRARY
* VDP:
 - fixed palette fading methods where the last frame colors weren't always correct.
 - VDP_drawImage(..) and VDP_drawBitmap(..) now use dynamic VRAM tile index so they does not erase anymore the previous drawn image.
   'curTileInd' variable which contains the VRAM tile index where next tile will be uploaded is public.
* TILE:
 - fixed somes bugs in the tile cache engine.
 - removed the MEM_free(..) call from the VInt callback (tile cache engine).
   So we don't need anymore to disable interrupts at each memory allocation operation for safety ;)
* SPRITE:
 - fixed somes bugs in the sprite engine. 
 - added SPR_setAlwaysVisible(..) and SPR_setNeverVisible(..) to force (not) visibility on sprite (sprite engine)
* BITMAP:
 - minor performance improvement on the BMP_drawPolygon(..) method.
* SOUND:
 - fixed YM2612 write methods (can have issue on MD2 system).
* DMA:
 - fixed VRam Copy DMA.
* MATH:
- fixed 2D projection calculation in M3D_project_xxx(..) methods.
  Now the camera distance is correctly taken in account for the final projection (adding a minor impact on performance).
* SYSTEM:
 - fixed soft reset issues.
* TIMER:
 - fixed a minor issue with getTime(..) method.
 - waitSubTick(..) is now more accurate when called from V-Interrupt code.
* SAMPLE:
 - minors changes and improvements on the Sonic Sprite sample.
 - minors changes to 3D cube flat sample.
* DEBUG:
 - added some KDebug log methods (KLog, KLog_Uxx, KLog_Sxx...)
* added strcmp(..) method.
* others changes and improvements.


SGDK 0.95 (feb 2014):
---------------------

COMPILER
* Major change on resource compilation:
  A new resource compiler tool (rescomp) is used to compile all resource files.
  It support many type of resources as BMP, PNG, WAV, PCM, VGM, TFM..
  Read the rescomp.txt file to have more informations about it and look in the 'sound' and 'sprite' sample example.
  You can also convert your old project by using the "rescomp -convert" command on the project folder to convert.
- added appack tool.
- minor fix in wavtoraw tool.

LIBRARY
* added GFX compression support (see tools.h file for doxygen documentation).
* VDP:
 - added VDP_getBackgroundColor() and VDP_setBackgroundColor(..) methods.
 - added VDP_get/setTextPlan(), VDP_get/setTextPalette() and VDP_get/setTextPriority() methods to change text drawing properties.
 - added VDP_drawBitmap(..) and VDP_drawBitmapEx(..) methods to draw Bitmap resource.
 - added VDP_drawImage(..) and VDP_drawImageEx(..) methods to draw Image resources.
 - added VDP_loadTileSet(..) method to load TileSet resource.
 - added VDP_setMap(..) and VDP_setMapEx(..) methods to load Map resources.
 - lot of refactoring in the setTileMap methods...
 - some tweaks.
* TILE:
 - added new tile cache engine for easier tile allocation in VRAM.
   See the tile_cache.h file for doxygen documentation.
* SPRITE:
 - added sprite engine for easier sprite manipulation.
   See the sprite_eng.h file for doxygen documentation and the included "sprite" sample for an example.
* SOUND:
 - added TFC_isPlaying() command for the 68k TFM driver.
 - fixed issue with consecutive play command on TFM Z80 driver.
 - Improved VGM driver (thanks to kubilus1 and sigflup).
   You can now pause, resume music and even better play PCM SFX !
 - now clear Z80 memory on driver loading to avoid any problems with var initialization.
* DMA:
  - minor change to VDP_doDMAEx(..) method, be careful if you use this method, the last parameter changed.
* JOY:
 - added JOY_waitPressTime() and JOY_waitPressBtnTime() methods.
 - JOY_waitPressBtn() and JOY_waitPress() now return button pressed info.
* MEMORY:
 - fixed a minor buf with dynamic memory allocation.
* SYSTEM:
 - added SYS_disableInts() and SYS_enableInts() methods.
 - added SYS_isInInterrupt() to detect if we are in an interrupt callback.
 - added SYS_getAndSetInterruptMaskLevel(..) method to "atomically" get and set interrupt mask level.
 - added SYS_die(..) for fatal error handling.
* library font is now included as an image.
* added some logs for easier debugging (KDebug message).
* many others smalls improvements.
* lot of refactoring.


SGDK 0.94 (feb 2013):
---------------------

* Major rewrite of the Bitmap engine:
 - Fixed 256x160 resolution.
 - Removed all specifics flags as it now always use deferred flip operation with extended blank.
 - Simpler and easier to use.
 - Better performance (20 FPS in NTSC, 25 FPS in PAL).
 - Backface culling now directly handled in the BMP_drawPolygon(..) method.
 - Removed useless FF BMP engine (too complex, incomplete..)
 - Many others changes you will discover :)
* Added "Bitmap" structure for better bitmap handling.
  SGDK automatically convert 16 colors bitmap images to "Bitmap".
* Major rewrite of Maths3D engine:
  - Added many 3D related structures (as matrix, transform..).
  - More flexibility.
  - Improved performance (not much).
* added DMA capability to VDP_setHorizontalScrollxxx(..) / VDP_setVerticalScrollTile(..) functions.
* Added VDP_doDMAEx(..) so we can specify if we modify the VRam step.
* Refactored palette functions.
* Fixed QSort function.
* Removed useless VRAM table (eat rom space for minor speed boost).
* Minors fixes/tweaks in memset and memcpy functions.
* Updated WavToRaw tool (now support any output rate).
* Added Genitile 1.7 sources.
* Minors tweaks on makefile.
* Fixed a minor issue in rom_head (Thanks Chilly Willy).
* Updated demo samples.
* Others minors changes or improvements.

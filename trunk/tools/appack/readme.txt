About
-----

aPLib is a compression library based on the algorithm used in aPACK (my
16-bit executable packer). aPLib is an easy-to-use alternative to many of the
heavy-weight compression libraries available.

The compression ratios achieved by aPLib combined with the speed and tiny
footprint of the depackers (as low as 169 bytes!) makes it the ideal choice
for many products.

Please read the documentation file 'doc/aPLib-1.1.0.chm' or
'doc/html/index.html'.

SGDK 0.96 (may 2014)
--------------------

COMPILER

LIBRARY
* VDP:
 - fixed palette fading methods where the last frame colors weren't always correct.
 - VDP_drawImage(..) and VDP_drawBitmap(..) now use dynamic VRAM tile index so they does not erase anymore the previous drawn image.
   'curTileInd' variable which contains the VRAM tile index where next tile will be uploaded is public.
* TILE:
 - fixed somes bugs in the tile cache engine.
 - removed the MEM_free(..) call from the VInt callback (tile cache engine).
   So we don't need anymore to disable interrupts at each memory allocation operation for safety ;)

 - fixed somes bugs in the sprite engine. 
 - added SPR_setAlwaysVisible(..) and SPR_setNeverVisible(..) to force (not) visibility on sprite (sprite engine)
* BITMAP:
 - minor performance improvement on the BMP_drawPolygon(..) method.
* SOUND:
 - fixed YM2612 write methods (can have issue on MD2 system).

  Now the camera distance is correctly taken in account for the final projection (adding a minor impact on performance).
* SYSTEM:
 - fixed soft reset issues.
* TIMER:
 - fixed a minor issue with getTime(..) method.
 - waitSubTick(..) is now more accurate when called from V-Interrupt code.

--------------------

COMPILER
* Major change on resource compilation:
  A new resource compiler tool (rescomp) is used to compile all resource files.
  It support many type of resources as BMP, PNG, WAV, PCM, VGM, TFM..
  Read the rescomp.txt file to have more informations about it and look in the 'sound' and 'sprite' sample example.
  You can also convert your old project by using the "rescomp -convert" command on the project folder to convert.
- added appack tool.

   You can now pause, resume music and even better play PCM SFX !
 - now clear Z80 memory on driver loading to avoid any problems with var initialization.
* DMA:
  - minor change to VDP_doDMAEx(..) method, be careful if you use this method, the last parameter changed.
* JOY:

* Added "Bitmap" structure for better bitmap handling.
  SGDK automatically convert 16 colors bitmap images to "Bitmap".

* added DMA capability to VDP_setHorizontalScrollxxx(..) / VDP_setVerticalScrollTile(..) functions.
* Added VDP_doDMAEx(..) so we can specify if we modify the VRam step.
* Refactored palette functions.
* Fixed QSort function.

* Updated WavToRaw tool (now support any output rate).

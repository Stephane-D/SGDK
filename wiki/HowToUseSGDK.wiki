#summary Installation and use of SGDK from command line (Windows OS only).
#labels Phase-Deploy

 # Download the SGDK archive from the [http://code.google.com/p/sgdk/downloads/list Download page] and unzip it where it suits to you (for instance D:/sgdk).
 # Define _GDK_ environment variable to your installation path in unix path format (example D:/sgdk).
 # Define _GDK_WIN_ which still point to your installation path but in windows format (exemple D:\sgdk).
 # Add the _bin_ directory of devkit (%GDK_WIN%\bin) to your PATH variable. Be careful, if you have another GCC installation you can have some conflicts when cc1 command will be called...
 # Now you can compile the library by using
{{{
%GDK_WIN%\bin\make -f %GDK_WIN%\makelib.gen
}}}
 # When the library is compiled you should obtain the following files
{{{
%GDK%/lib/libmd.a
}}}
 # Before compiling your own project you first need to respect the following constraint in your project source tree:
  * sources files (C, S, ASM, S80): root directory or _src_ directory
  * includes files (H, INC): root directory or _include_ directory
  * primary resource files (C, S, RC, RES): root directory or _res_ directory
  * others resources files (TFC, TFD, PCM, RAW, WAV, BIN, BMP, PNG): can be wherever you want while you are referring them correctly in your resource definition files
 # Then to compile your project you need to use the following command directly from your project directory :
{{{
%GDK_WIN%\bin\make -f %GDK_WIN%\makefile.gen
}}}


Normally you should obtain a rom.bin file in the out directory.

Then test it with an emulator (or directly on the hardware if you are a lucky owner of a flash cart).

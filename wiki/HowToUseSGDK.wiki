#summary How to use SGDK from command line (Windows OS only).
#labels Phase-Deploy

 * Download the SGDK archive from the [http://code.google.com/p/sgdk/downloads/list Download page] and unzip it where it suits to you (for instance D:/sgdk).
 * Define "GDK" environment variable to your installation path in unix path format (example D:/sgdk).
 * Define "GDK_WIN" which still point to your installation path but in windows format (exemple D:\sgdk).
 * Add the "bin" directory of devkit (%GDK_WIN%\bin) to your PATH variable. Be careful, if you have another GCC installation you can have some conflicts when cc1 command will be called...
 * Now you can compile the library by using
{{{
%GDK_WIN%\bin\make -f %GDK_WIN%\makelib.gen
}}}
 * When the library is compiled you should obtain the following files
{{{
%GDK%/lib/libmd.a
}}}
 * Before compiling your own project you first need to respect the following constraint in your project source tree:
   * sources files (C, S, ASM, S80):
  root directory or "src" directory
  * includes files (H, INC):
  root directory or "include" directory
  * primary resource files (C, S, RC, RES):
  root directory or "res" directory 
  * others resources files (TFC, TFD, PCM, RAW, WAV, BIN, BMP, PNG):
  can be wherever you want while you are referring them correctly in your resource definition files
 * Then to compile your project you need to use the following command directly from your project directory :
{{{
%GDK_WIN%\bin\make -f %GDK_WIN%\makefile.gen
}}}


Normally you should obtain a rom.bin file in the out directory.

Then test it with an emulator (or directly on the hardware if you are a lucky owner of a flash cart).

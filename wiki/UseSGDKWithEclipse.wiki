#summary Integrate SGDK with Eclipse CDT

*Here's how to use the devkit with Eclipse CDT IDE*

== Setup your files ==
Download Eclipse CDT at http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/downloads.php

 * Create a directory for Genesis development only, *without* space or special chars
 * Unzip EclipseCDT and SGDK there
 * Rename SGDK's one as "_sdk_" 
 * Create an other directory called "_projects_".
In the end, you have
{{{
<parent folder>
	->eclipse folder
	->sdk folder
	->projects folder
}}}

== Setup Eclipse ==
Launch Eclipse and select _<parent folder>/projects_ as workspace folder
{{{
 each new project will be added to this folder by Eclipse 
}}}

Go to the workbench and select menu _Window > Preferences_ to setup Eclipse

In _General > Workspace_, select _*Save automatically before build*_ and unselect _*Build automatically*_

In _C/C++ > Build > Build Variables_, add a new variable :
 * Variable name : GDK
 * Type : Directory
 * Value : (browse to <parent folder>/sdk)

{{{
 this will define $GDK needed by sdk/makefile.gen
}}}

In _C/C++ > Build > Environnement_, add a new variable
 * Name : GDK
 * Value : (_full path to  <parent folder>/sdk_)
 
{{{
 this will define a var used on Eclipse IDE
}}}

In _C/C++ > New CDT Project Wizard > Makefile Project_
 * unselect _*Use default build command*_ in _Builder Settings_ tab
 * set, as _Build command_,  `${GDK}\bin\make -f ${GDK}\makefile`

{{{
 this will define  sdk/makefile.gen as the default makefile of any project
}}}

== Setup Project ==
You could now create a new project (_File > New > C Project_).

Right-click on it and select _Properties_ to setup the project itself.

In _C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols_, add a new directory in _Includes_ tab
 * Directory : `${GDK}/include`
 * Add to all configurations
 * Add to all languages

Click _Apply_ and rebuild the index

{{{
this will make available the headers on <parent folder>/sdk/include to your project
}}}


On _Make Target_ view, create a new target for your project.
 * give it a name
 * unselect _*Same as the target name*_
 * empty _Make target_ field
http://sgdk.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pictures/eclipse07.jpg
{{{
 double click on this target to generate a out/rom.bin according your project's file, sdk/makefile.gen and sgdk library
}}}

== Setup Gens ==
If you want to launch the rom on Gens from Eclipse
 * Right click on the generated out/rom.bin.
 * Select _Open With > Others..._
 * Browse for _gens.exe_ on _External programs_ tab

== Common error ==
If you have an error on build like *`main() not found`*, be sure to click _*Apply*_ on project properties's _C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols_.

Another source of problem : be sure to un-mark _Project>Build automatically_

*LIBRARY*
 * minors changes to Doxygen documentation.


== Changelog 0.96 ==

*COMPILER*
 * Rescomp
  * improved BMP image support.
  * byte data are now output in word format to avoid the GCC bug (compilation with `-g` flag fails when byte data is encountered).
  * fixed issue on empty sprite animation detection.
  * fixed path separator issue on old windows system.
  * fixed compilation issues on unix system.
 * Makefile
  * Added `release` and `debug` targets to makefile (default target is `release`, `debug` target allow you to use GDB interactive debugger through emulator supporting it).
 * added `appack` tool sources code (compatibility for linux system).
 * some cleanup in `bintos` tool (removed the useless `-sizealign` command done by `sizebnd` tool).

*LIBRARY*
 * VDP
  * fixed palette fading methods where the last frame colors weren't always correct.
  * `VDP_drawImage(..)` and `VDP_drawBitmap(..)` now use dynamic VRAM tile index so they does not erase anymore the previous drawn image. `curTileInd` variable which contains the VRAM tile index where next tile will be uploaded is public.
 * TILE
  * fixed some bugs in the tile cache engine.
  * removed the`MEM_free(..)` call from the VInt callback (tile cache engine). We don't need anymore to disable interrupts at each memory allocation operation for safety ;)
 * SPRITE
  * fixed some bugs in the sprite engine. 
  * added `SPR_setAlwaysVisible(..)` and `SPR_setNeverVisible(..)` to force (not) visibility on sprite (sprite engine)
 * BITMAP
  * minor performance improvement on the `BMP_drawPolygon(..)` method.
 * SOUND
  * fixed YM2612 write methods (can have issue on Megadrive 2 system).
 * DMA
  * fixed VRam Copy DMA.
 * MATH
  * fixed 2D projection calculation in `M3D_project_xxx(..)` methods. Now the camera distance is correctly taken in account for the final projection (adding a minor impact on performance).
 * SYSTEM
  * fixed soft reset issues.
 * TIMER
  * fixed a minor issue with `getTime(..)` method.
  * `waitSubTick(..)` is now more accurate when called from V-Interrupt code.
 * SAMPLE
  * minors changes and improvements on the Sonic Sprite sample.
  * minors changes to 3D cube flat sample.
 * DEBUG
  * added some KDebug log methods (`KLog, KLog_Uxx, KLog_Sxx...`)
 * MISC
  * added `strcmp(..)` method.
  * others changes and improvements.

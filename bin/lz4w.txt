LZ4W packer 1.2 (december 2017)

LZ4W is part of SGDK (aka Sega Genesis Dev Kit).
It's a custom packer based on LZ4 compression scheme: https://github.com/lz4/lz4
The 'W' suffix stands for 'Word' as LZ4W only uses word memory accesses.
The main difference is that LZ4W is designed to take advantage of 16 bits CPU and achieve better decompression 
performance on these CPU compared to classic LZ4.

The compression ratio offered by LZ4W is not as good to LZ4 but close enough depending the input data.
Note that LZ4W support using previous data buffer to improve compression if available.

Decompression speed (running a 7.67 Mhz 68000 using optimized assembly code)
-------------------
LZ4     min=270KB/s   max=390KB/s
LZ4W    min=550KB/s   max=900KB/s

As you can see the speed difference is very important, LZ4W can unpack at least twice as fast than classic LZ4 !


Compression ratio (using LZ4HC which provide the best compression ratio for LZ4)
-----------------
linear tiles data           original=12672    LZ4HC=6622    LZ4W=6588
planar tiles data           original=1536     LZ4HC=1061    LZ4W=1038
highly compressible tiles   original=346656   LZ4HC=24613   LZ4W=27176
single BMP sprite           original=4798     LZ4HC=2202    LZ4W=2160
map data                    original=4576     LZ4HC=1367    LZ4W=1312
text file                   original=40992    LZ4HC=16088   LZ4W=21422

As you can see LZ4W performs not too bad compared to LZ4 for small packet of data (it often do better than LZ4HC)
but it becomes a bit worst as the data packet become larger or using redudant byte pattern data (as TXT file).

Keep LZ4W has been developed for the Sega Megadrive target in mind which has very limited amount of RAM anyway (64 KB) so
you're likely to unpack small block of data almost of time ;)

Still i think for anyone looking for very fast unpacker LZ4W is probably the best solution around for 68000 CPU based systems.
68000 unpacking code can be found in SGDK library (https://stephane-d.github.io/SGDK/)
LZ4W compressor is provided in JAR format (java code) in SGDK package so it requires a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to work.
Use the following command to execute it: java -jar lz4w.jar

LZ4W format description
-----------------------
0000-xxxx: LZ4W compressed blocks

Each block consists of a 16 bit block header optionally followed by a literal data block and an optional
long offset word for long match block.
At this point you need to know the principe of the LZ77 compression format on which LZ4 and LZ4W are based.

block header format (16 bit)
----------------------------
LLLL MMMM OOOO OOOO

LLLL = literal size (in word)                   if > 0 then a literal data block follow the block header
MMMM = match size - 1 (in word)                 if (MMMM == 1) then we have a match size of 2 words
OOOOOOOO = match offset - 1 (in word)           if (OOOOOOOO == 0) then we have a match offset of 1 word

* if (LLLL == 0) && (MMMM == 0) && (OOOOOOOO == 0) --> end (see ending block description)
* if (LLLL == 0) --> no literal data
* if (MMMM == 0)
  * if (OOOOOOOO == 0) --> no match data
  * if (OOOOOOOO != 0) --> long match block
    OOOOOOOO = match length - 2 (in word)       if (OOOOOOOO == 1) then we have a match length of 3 words
    next word *after* literal data block = match offset - 1 (in word)

ending block
------------
Ending block consists of a last word data:
Dxxx xxxx YYYY YYYY

if (D != 0) YYYY YYYY = last byte of data

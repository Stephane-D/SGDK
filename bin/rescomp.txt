ResComp 3.90 (November 2024)
Copyright Stephane Dallongeville
https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK

ResComp is part of SGDK (aka Sega Genesis Dev Kit) so refer to SGDK licence for licensing.
It allows to compile different type of resource and output them in assembly source form (GAS format).

Usage
-----
rescomp input [output] [-noheader] [-dep <target_file>]
    input: the input resource file (.res)
    output: the asm output filename (if ommited then use input name with .s extension)
    -noheader: specify that we don't want to generate the header file (.h)
    -dep: generate dependencies file (.d) for make (experimental)
        <target_file> allow to specify the target filename in the .d file (not the destination of the .d file itself)
        
Example:
  rescomp resources.res outres.s
  rescomp resources.res outres.s -noheader -dep
  rescomp resources.res outres.s -dep out/res/gfx.o


Supported resource type
-----------------------
- BITMAP    bitmapped image type resource, used for the Bitmap SGDK engine (do not use it as tile resource).
- PALETTE   palette type resource, used as color input for Bitmap, Image or Sprite resource.
- TILESET   tileset type resource, contains tiles data which can be used / shared for TILEMAP and MAP resources.
- TILEMAP   tilemap type resource, contains raw tilemap data. It can be used to draw an image or complete (but small) plane background.
- MAP       map type resource, optimized to draw large map / level.
- IMAGE     image type resource, internally contains Palette, Tileset and Tilemap data. It can be used to draw an image or complete (but small)
            plane background.
- SPRITE    sprite type resource, used to handle sprites with the SGDK Sprite engine.
- XGM       XGM music type resource (.vgm or .xgm file), used to play music.
- WAV       WAV sound type resource (.wav file), used to play sample sound data.
- BIN       any binary data file which do not need any specific conversion or processing.

Supported function
------------------
- ALIGN     align *binary* data for the whole resource file
- UNGROUP   by default rescomp will group data export by type, using "UNGROUP" allow to disable that feature.
- NEAR      force all resources from the file to be exported as NEAR ("not FAR") data.
            By default binary data are exported as "FAR" data, that means they are located in the end of the ROM and can require
            bankswitch mechanism if the ROM is larger than 4MB. Using "NEAR" force all binary data from the file to be located before "FAR" data
            in the ROM.

Extensions
----------
Rescomp support custom resource using extensions.
Making an extension is easy: just write your own resource type and its processor in Java and export compiled classes as 'rescomp_ext.jar'.
Put the file in the same folder as the .res files you want to compile and rescomp should find it automatically !
You can look at the sgdk.rescomp.resource.Palette and sgdk.rescomp.processor.PaletteProcessor source files to get an example
about how to implement a Resource and a Processor :)

            
Important note about image format
---------------------------------
Many resource types use image file as input and Rescomp now supports both RGB images and indexed color images :)
Here're some important informations to know about how to use properly these 2 image formats:
* RGB images
  When using RGB image rescomp does not have any information about palette so they should be defined somewhere in the image.
  Rescomp expect the palette to be located in the top-left part of the image where each color is defined by a 8x8 tile and each sub palette
  (16 colors) being on a separate row of tiles. You need to have the 4 sub palettes (4x16 colors) in the image even if only the first one is
  really used (there is no reliable way to detect automatically the number of palette row).
  See the rgb_example.png image in the 'sample/game/sonic/res/gfx' folder if you want an example.
  Note that when processing the image rescomp will automatically remove the palette part of the image to not disturb process (not adding extra
  tiles for instance) so you shouldn't put any tileset data in the right part of the palette rows.
* Indexed color images
  rescomp supports 8bpp, 4bpp, 2bpp and even 1bpp indexed color image and will always directly use the palette data from the image so it's
  *very* important to properly setup the palette in the image (color at position #0 is the transparent color). Some softwares as Asesprite let
  you setup your palette as you wish. An advantage of using indexed colors is that you can use color >= 128 with 8bpp images to define priority
  information (more detail about it in resource description).


PALETTE
-------
Take a .pal file or an image as input and transform it into SGDK Palette structure.
See the note above about how palette is retrieved from RGB or indexed color images.
Palette is used as color input for Bitmap, Image and Sprite resources.

Syntax:
PALETTE name file

    name            name of the output Bitmap structure
    file            path of the input image file (BMP or PNG image) or PAL file (Paint Shop Pro palette)
                        See the note about image format at the beginning of the file


BITMAP
------
Take an image as input and transform it into SGDK Bitmap structure.
Bitmap image structure is used for the SGDK BMP (bitmap) engine, do not use it for tiled image.

Syntax:
BITMAP name img_file [compression]

    name            name of the output Bitmap structure
    img_file        path of the input image file (BMP or PNG image)
                        See the note about image format at the beginning of the file
    compression     compression type (use unpackBitmap(..) to unpack), accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression (default)
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)


TILESET
-------
Take an image or TSX file as input and transform it into SGDK TileSet structure.
TileSet is used as tiles source for Image, Tilemap, Map and Sprite resources.
If you use a real 'tileset format' image as input (as a font) then you should set 'opt' parameter to 'NONE'
to avoid removing duplicated tiles (which may exist).

Syntax:
TILESET name file [compression [opt [ordering [export]]]]

    name            name of the output TileSet structure
    file            path of the input file (BMP, PNG image file or TSX Tiled file)
                        See the note about image format at the beginning of the file
    compression     compression type (use unpackTileSet(..) to unpack), accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression (default)
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)
    opt             define the optimisation level, accepted values:
                        0 / NONE        = no optimisation, each tile is unique
                        1 / ALL         = ignore duplicated and flipped tile (default)
                        2 / DUPLICATE   = ignore duplicated tile only
    ordering        define the tile process order, accepted values:
                        ROW             = process per row (default)
                        COLUMN          = process per column
    export          enable the tileset PNG export, accept values:
                        0 / FALSE       = no PNG export (default)
                        1 / TRUE        = optimized tileset is export to PNG format '<file>-tileset-export.png'
                        
Tips:
When using a 8bpp indexed image as input you can use the extra bits of palette to provide extra information for the TILEMAP data but you have to
ensure that all pixels from a same tile (block of 8x8 pixels) use the same value otherwise rescomp will generate an error.
    bit 4-5: palette index (0-3) so it allows to use the 4 available palettes to draw the tilemap / MAP.
    bit 6: not used (ignored)
    bit 7: priority information (0=LOW 1=HIGH)
    

TILEMAP
-------
Take an image or a TMX file as input and transform it into SGDK TileMap structure.
TileMap is used to draw in background plane, it requires a tileset which can be shared with others tilemaps.
TILEMAP resource isn't meant to be used to store large background level (eat too much space), use MAP resource for that.

Syntax (image file input):
TILEMAP name img_file tileset_id [compression [map_opt [map_base [ordering]]]]

    name            name of the output TileMap structure
    img_file        path of the input image file (BMP or PNG image file)
                        See the note about image format at the beginning of the file
    tileset_id      base tileset resource to use (allow to share tileset along several tilemaps)
    compression     compression type (use unpackTileMap(..) to unpack), accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression (default)
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)
    map_opt         define the tilemap optimisation level, accepted values:
                        0 / NONE        = no optimisation, each tile is unique
                        1 / ALL         = find duplicated and flipped tile (default)
                        2 / DUPLICATE   = find duplicated tile only
    map_base        define the base tilemap value, useful to set a default priority, palette and base tile index offset.
                        using a base tile index offset (static tile allocation) allow to use the faster VDP_setTileMapxxx(..) functions.
    ordering        define the tilemap process order, accepted values:
                        ROW             = process per row (default)
                        COLUMN          = process per column
                                
Syntax (TMX tiled file input):
TILEMAP name tmx_file layer_id [ts_compression [map_compression [map_base]]]

    name                name of the output TileMap structure
    tmx_file            path of the input TMX file (TMX Tiled file with CSV encoded map data)
    layer_id            layer name we want to extract map data from.
    ts_compression      compression type for tileset, accepted values:
                           -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                            0 / NONE        = no compression (default)
                            1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                            2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)
    map_compression     compression type for map (same accepted values than 'ts_compression')
    map_base            define the base tilemap value, useful to set a default priority, palette and base tile index offset.
                            using a base tile index offset (static tile allocation) allow to use the faster VDP_setTileMapxxx(..) functions.
    ordering            define the tilemap process order, accepted values:
                            ROW             = process per row (default)
                            COLUMN          = process per column

Tips:
When using a 8bpp indexed image as input you can use the extra bits of palette to provide extra information for the TILEMAP data but you have to
ensure that all pixels from a same tile (block of 8x8 pixels) use the same value otherwise rescomp will generate an error.
    bit 4-5: palette index (0-3) so it allows to use the 4 available palettes to draw the tilemap / MAP.
    bit 6: not used (ignored)
    bit 7: priority information (0=LOW 1=HIGH)
When using a TMX Tiled file you can define the priority information in different ways:
- use 2 layers where the low priority layer's name is suffixed by ' low' and high prority layer is suffixed by ' high'
- use 2 layers with the main layer define the map itself and a second layer suffixed by ' priority' or ' prio' containing the priority information (0/1)
Note that it's always possible to set priority on a 8x8 tile basis using the second method by using the tileset information:
- full transparent 8x8 tile is considered as LOW priority
- 8x8 tile containing at least 1 non transparent pixel is considered as HIGH priority


MAP
---
Take an image or TMX file as input and transform it into SGDK Map structure.
Map is used to define a large background/plane data, it's different from the IMAGE resource as MAP uses an advanced encoding
so it can encode large background while taking much less ROM space than IMAGE resource so use it to handle large level.

Syntax:
MAP name img_file tileset_id [compression [map_base]]

    name            name of the output Map structure
    img_file        path of the input image file (BMP or PNG image file)
                        See the note about image format at the beginning of the file
    tileset_id      base tileset resource to use (allow to share tileset along several tilemaps)
    compression     compression type, accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression (default)
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)
    map_base        define the base tilemap value, useful to set a default priority, palette and base tile index offset.
                        using a base tile index offset (static tile allocation) allow to use faster MAP decoding function internally.
                                
MAP name tmx_file layer_id [ts_compression [map_compression [map_base [ordering]]]]

    name                name of the output Map structure
    tmx_file            path of the input TMX file (TMX Tiled file with CSV encoded map data)
    layer_id            layer name we want to extract map data from.
    ts_compression      compression type for tileset, accepted values:
                           -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                            0 / NONE        = no compression (default)
                            1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                            2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)
    map_compression     compression type for map (same accepted values than 'ts_compression')
    map_base            define the base tilemap value, useful to set a default priority, palette and base tile index offset.
                            using a base tile index offset (static tile allocation) allow to use faster MAP decoding function internally.
    ordering            define the map process order, accepted values:
                            ROW             = process per row (default)
                            COLUMN          = process per column

  - full transparent 8x8 tile is considered as LOW priority  
  - 8x8 tile containing at least 1 non transparent pixel is considered as HIGH priority


OBJECTS
-------
Take a TMX file as input and transform it into an array of Object (actually an array of object pointer).
These objects can be used to define almost anything you want to attach to a specific MAP (entities, events, actions... whatever we can think of).
Objects are built using the object layers of Tiled TMX file and since Tiled 1.8 you can define your own Object type letting you to build your own
custom objects that you can import through rescomp.

Here's the accepted SGDK type(s) for each 'Tiled' type:
  Tiled   SGDK
  bool    bool
  color   u32
  float   f32, f16, s32, u32, s16, u16
  file    NOT SUPPORTED
  int     f32, f16, s32, u32, s16, u16, s8, u8
  Object  object (internally void*)
  string  string (internally char*)
  Enum    u8, u16, u32
  
As you can see, you can also use your own enumerations in which case you need to save them as number (not string) and make
sure they perfectly match your C enums (be careful about the allocated type size for your enum, default is u32 with GCC).

The Tiled objects has some default attributes that you can use:
- 'id' is used internally by rescomp and Tiled and not exported as field, but you can define your own custom 'id' field if you want.
- 'type' is only used as type filter (see the optional 'type_filter' parameter below) and not exported as field but you can define
  your own custom 'type' field (as an integer) if needed.
- 'name' can be exported in string format.
  To enable export of that field you need to add a custom boolean 'exportName' field and set its value to 'true'.
- 'x' and 'y' define the object position on the map and can be exported in any number format.
  To enable export of these fields, you need to add a custom boolean 'exportPosition' field and set its value to 'true'.
- 'width' and 'height' (only for shape objects) define the shape dimensionand can be exported in any number format.
  To enable export of these fields, you need to add a custom boolean 'exportSize' field and set its value to 'true'.
  
Syntax:
OBJECTS name tmx_file layer_id field_defs [decl_type [type_filter]]

    name                name of the output array Objects structure
    tmx_file            path of the input TMX file (TMX Tiled file)
    layer_id            object group/layer name we want to export object from.
    field_defs          name and type of fields we want to export (also define the order of extraction) in <name>:<type> format.
                            Field type can be any of the usual SGDK base type: u8, s8, u16, s16, u32, s32, f16, f32, bool, string, object
                            Some examples of 'field_defs' declaration:
                                "type:u16;name:string;x:f32;y:f32;tileindex:u32"
                                "type:u16;power:s8;visible:bool"
                            Note that not found fields are just ignored so you can extract different object types at same time easily.
    decl_type           declaration type for objects (default is "void").
                            By default object array is untyped (void) but you can specify your own type if you want ("Object", "Entity", ...)
    type_filter         define a type filter if we only want to extract Tiled objects of a specific type (see above).

Tips:
- Objects are sorted (ascending order) using the values of these fields (in this order): 'index', 'ind', 'tileIndex', 'id' .
- You can export the tile index value corresponding to x + (y * map_width)) in 'tileIndex' field by adding a custom boolean 'exportTileIndex'
  field with value set to 'true'. When you enable the 'tileIndex' export then objects are sorted (ascending order) using the field value
  allowing fast tile index based searchs (be careful: 'index' or 'ind' fields has priority for sorting if they exist).


IMAGE
-----
Take an image as input and transform it into SGDK Image structure.
Image is used to directly draw image in background plane, it internally contains a Palette, TileSet and TileMap structure.
IMAGE resource isn't meant to be used to store large background level (eat too much space), use MAP resource for that.

Syntax:
IMAGE name img_file [compression [map_opt [map_base]]]

    name            name of the output Image structure
    img_file        path of the input image file (BMP or PNG image)
                        See the note about image format at the beginning of the file
    compression     compression type (use unpackImage(..) to unpack), accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression (default)
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)
    map_opt         define the tilemap optimisation level, accepted values:
                        0 / NONE        = no optimisation (each tile is unique)
                        1 / ALL         = find duplicated and flipped tile (default)
                        2 / DUPLICATE   = find duplicated tile only
    map_base        define the base tilemap value, useful to set a default priority, palette and base tile index offset.
                    Using a base tile index offset (static tile allocation) allow to use the faster VDP_xxxTileMapxxx(..) functions.

Tips:
When using a 8bpp indexed image as input you can use the extra bits of palette to provide extra information for the TILEMAP data but you have to
ensure that all pixels from a same tile (block of 8x8 pixels) use the same value otherwise rescomp will generate an error.
    bit 4-5: palette index (0-3) so it allows to use the 4 available palettes to draw the tilemap / MAP.
    bit 6: not used (ignored)
    bit 7: priority information (0=LOW 1=HIGH)


SPRITE
------
Take an image as input and transform it into SGDK SpriteDefinition structure.
SpriteDefinition is used to draw, animate and manage sprites, it internally contains severals TileSet, Palette and Animation structures.

Syntax:
SPRITE name img_file width height [compression [time [collision [opt_type [opt_level [opt_duplicate]]]]]]

    name            name of the output SpriteDefinition structure
    img_file        path of the input image file (BMP or PNG image)
                        See the note about image format at the beginning of the file
    width           width of a single sprite frame in tile (should be < 32)
    height          height of a single sprite frame in tile (should be < 32)
    compression     compression type, accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression (default)
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow, don't use it for streamed sprite)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast, recommended for streamed sprite)
    time            display frame time in 1/60 of second (time between each animation frame)
                        If this value is set to 0 (default) then auto animation is disabled.
                        It can be either set globally (single value) or independently for each frame of each animation.
                        Example for 3 anim x 5 frame sprite sheet:
                        [[3,3,3,4,4][4,5,5][2,3,3,4]]
                        No space allowed ! And you can have empty value for empty frame.
    collision       collision type: CIRCLE, BOX or NONE (NONE by default)
    opt_type        sprite cutting optimization strategy, accepted values:
                        0 / BALANCED  = balance between used tiles and hardware sprites (default)
                        1 / SPRITE    = reduce the number of hardware sprite (using bigger sprite) at the expense of more used tiles
                        2 / TILE      = reduce the number of tiles at the expense of more hardware sprite (using smaller sprite)
                        3 / NONE      = no optimization (cover the whole sprite frame)
    opt_level       optimization level for the sprite cutting operation:
                        0 / FAST      = fast optimisation, good enough in general (default)
                        1 / MEDIUM    = intermediate optimisation level, provide better results than FAST but ~10 time slower
                        2 / SLOW      = advanced optimisation level using a genetic algorithm (80000 iterations), ~25 time slower than FAST
                        3 / MAX       = maximum optimisation level, genetic algorithm (500000 iterations), ~150 time slower than FAST
    opt_duplicate   enabled optimization of consecutive duplicated frames by removing them and increasing animation time to compensante.
                        FALSE  = no optimization (default)
                                 Note that duplicated frames pixel data are still removed by rescomp binary blob optimizer.
                        TRUE   = only the first instance of duplicated frames is kept and 'timer' value is increased to compensate the removed frames time.
                                 Note that it *does* change the 'animation.numFrame' information so beware of that when enabling this optimization.

Some informations about how SpriteDefinition is generated from the input image:
- input image dimension should be aligned on tile (multiple of 8).
- input image is a grid where each cell represents a single animation frame and where each row define a complete sprite animation.
- an animation cannot contains more than 255 frames.
- cell size (frame size) = width * height (in tile) where width and height should be < 32 (maximum = 248 pixels for both width and height).
- a frame can be composed of several internal VDP (hardware) sprites but it stricly limited to a maximum of 16 hardware sprites.
  If the sprite is too large to fit in 16 hardware sprites (rescomp will complain about it), then you may reduce its size or split it in 2 parts.
- rescomp detects flipped frame to avoid redundant sprite tiles.
- rescomp detects empty frame at end of animation row to not store empty frame data.
- rescomp try to optimize hardware sprites and vRAM usage by detecting empty areas in sprite frames.
- rescomp detects frame copy inside an animation to generate the according animation sequence.
- by default collision bounds are calculated by using 75% of the original sprite frame.

Tips: When the 'opt_level' is set (non empty value) then rescomp will automatically generate an image saved as <input_image>_opt.png
representing the processed sprite cutting operation.

    far             'far' binary data flag to put it at the end of the ROM (useful for bank switch, default = TRUE)


BIN
---
Take any data file as input and transform it into binary data array accessible through SGDK.

    fill            fill value for the size alignment (default is 0)
    compression     compression type, accepted values:
                        0 / NONE        = no compression
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)

ALIGN
-----
Align *binary* data for the *whole* resource file so you can have only ALIGN directive per resource (.res) file.
ALIGN function is useful when using bank switch for ROM larger than 4MB, it allows to avoid having a block of data crossing 2 data banks.
If you need several data alignments then you have to use several resources files.
Note that if you omit [value] parameter by default data is aligned on 512KB as this is the bank size when using bank switch mechanism.

Syntax:
ALIGN [value]

    value           specifies the minimum binary data alignment in bytes (default is 524288 = bank size)


UNGROUP
-------
By default rescomp will group data export by type of data, this generally allow better LZ4W compression.
Using UNGROUP function allow to disable that feature, that might be useful to help in bank data separation when using the bank switch mechanism.

Syntax:
UNGROUP


NEAR
----
By default binary data are always exported as "FAR" data, that means they are located in the end of the ROM and can require bank switch mechanism
if the ROM is larger than 4MB. Using NEAR function allow all binary data from the file to be located before all FAR data in the ROM.

Syntax:
NEAR

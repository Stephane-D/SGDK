XGM Driver
----------
The XGM name stands for "eXtended Genesis Music", the XGM driver is a music driver developed specifically for the Sega Megadrive/Genesis system.

It runs at 100% on the Z80 CPU and left the 68000 free for others tasks.
It has been designed to minimize CPU decoding resource and keep reasonable data size (should be smaller than VGM file).
It supports both FM and PSG chip and allow up to 4 PCM channels (8 bits signed at 14 Khz) to be played at once. PCM samples can be >32KB, the only restriction is that they should have their address and size aligned to 256 bytes. These 4 PCM channels are obtained by software mixing in the FM DAC in replacement of the 6th FM channel (so at best you can have 5FM + 4PCM + 4PSG = 13 channels)
The driver supports playing SFX in PCM format with 16 priority levels, eventually you can reserve some PSG channel to play SFX from the 68000 side.

The driver has been designed and developed for SGDK (https://code.google.com/p/sgdk/) by Stephane dallongeville (2014).

XGM file format specifications v1.01
------------------------------------
Any tracker supporting the export in XGM music file format should use this document as reference.
The produced XGM file can be compiled by the 'xgmtool' software (which is a part of SGDK) into a binary file (.bin or .xgc) ready to be played by the Z80 XGM driver.
The normal file extension for XGM file is .xgm but it can eventually be compressed (gzip compression) and use the .xgz extension instead.

File format (multi bytes value are in little endian format)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Address    Size    Description
$0000         4    XGM file ident, should be "XGM "
$0004       252    Sample id table.
                     This table contain the address and the size for all sample (maximum = 63 samples)
                     Each entry of the table consist of 4 bytes (2 bytes for address and 2 bytes for size):
                       entry+$0: sample address / 256
                       entry+$2: sample size / 256
                     We don't need the low 8 bits information as each sample have its address and size aligned on 256 bytes.
                     The sample address is relative to the start of the "Sample Data Bloc" (field $104).
                     An empty entry should have its address set to $FFFF and size set to $0001.
$0100         2    Sample data bloc size / 256, ex: $0010 means 256*16 = 4096 bytes
                     We will reference the value of this field as SLEN.
$0102         1    Version information (0 currently)                 
$0103         1    bit #0: NTSC / PAL information: 0=NTSC  1=PAL
                     This field is used to determine how interpret the frame wait command.
                     In NTSC mode a frame wait command is equivalent to 1/60 of second.
                     In PAL mode a frame wait command is equivalent to 1/50 of second.
                   bit #1 - bit #7: reserved for future use
$0104      SLEN    Sample data bloc, contains all sample data (8 bits signed format)
                     The size of this bloc is variable and is determined by the field $100.
                     If field $100 contains $0000 the bloc is empty and the field is ignored.
                     As explained in the 'Sample id table' field, sample size is aligned on 256 bytes.
$0104+SLEN    4    Music data bloc size.
                     We will reference the value of this field as MLEN.
                     This fields may be used later to quickly browse multi track XGM file.
$0108+SLEN MLEN    Music data bloc. It contains the XGM music data (see the XGM command description below).


XGM command description
-----------------------
Value         Size    Description
$00              1    frame wait (1/60 of second in NTSC, 1/50 of second in PAL)
$1X data   1+(X+1)    PSG register write:
                        X = number of byte to write - 1
                        data = byte data to write to PSG port ($4011)
$2X data  1+(2X+1)    YM2612 port 0 register write:
                        X = number of register write - 1
                        data = data to write to YM2612 port 0 ($4000 and $4001)
                          entry+$00: register number
                          entry+$01: register value
$3X data  1+(2X+1)    YM2612 port 1 register write:
                        X = number of register write - 1
                        data = data to write to YM2612 port 1 ($4002 and $4003)
                          entry+$00: register number
                          entry+$01: register value
$4X data   1+(X+1)    YM2612 key off/on ($28) command write:
                        X = number of key register write - 1
                        data = data to write to YM2612 key register
$5X id           2    PCM play command:
                        X = priority (X & 0xC) and channel number (X & 0x3)
                          Channel number varie from 0 to 3 as the driver allow to play up to 4 PCM at same time.
                          Priority level varie from 0 to 12 (in step of 4), higher value mean higher priority.
                          Ex: We have a sample playing on channel 0 with a priority of 5 (SFX).
                            - We receive a PCM play command with a priority of 4
                              --> command ignored
                            - We receive a PCM play command with a priority of 8
                              --> command is accepted and new sample replace old one, channel priority is changed to 8
                        id = sample id (should be < 64). Reference the sample id table to get address and size of sample.
                          sample address = (sampleIdTable[((id-1)*4) + 0] << 8) + (sampleIdTable[((id-1)*4) + 1] << 16)
                          sample size = (sampleIdTable[((id-1)*4) + 2] << 8) + (sampleIdTable[((id-1)*4) + 3] << 16)
                          Note that we use (id-1) as value 0 is a special value used to stop a PCM channel.
$7E dddddd       4    Loop command, used for music looping sequence:
                        dddddd = address where to loop relative to the start of music data bloc.
$7F              1    End command (end of music data).
